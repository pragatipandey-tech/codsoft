Titanic Survival Prediction
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning. By analyzing passenger details such as age, gender, travel class, and fare, the model learns patterns that help determine survival chances. This project demonstrates the complete data science workflow, from data cleaning to model evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Titanic Dataset obtained from Kaggle. It contains real passenger information including demographic details and survival status.

Technologies Used

Python for implementation

Pandas and NumPy for data handling and preprocessing

Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the machine learning model

Steps Followed

Explored and understood the dataset structure

Cleaned the data by handling missing values

Converted categorical features into numerical format

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Trained a Logistic Regression model

Evaluated the model performance using accuracy and other metrics

Result

The trained model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%, showing that features like gender and passenger class play a significant role in survival prediction.

Conclusion

This project helped strengthen my understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models. It also provided practical experience in building an end-to-end machine learning solution.
